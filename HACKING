Tips
====

* When creating conditionals in configure.ac, use 'test' instead of '['
because it conflicts with the M4 macro processor.
* autoconf's AC_CHECK_LIB does not detect stdcall.
* XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData and similar functions that deal with bitmaps, actually deal with XBM (monochrome) bitmaps. Do not try to load RGB bitmaps with them.

Ubuild
======

Yummy uses its own build system called Ubuild. It was inspired by the
Kbuild system used to build the Linux kernel.

To compile one or more files, create a file called 'Makefile.ubuild'.
The language used is the same used in Makefile files. Then use the
following variables.

obj-y (specifies the source files to link in the final program)
obj-m (specifies the source files to build as separate modules)
xxx_cflags and xxx_cppflags (flags to build the xxx file)
xxx_deps (specifies additional arguments at link time such as libraries)
subdirs-y (specifies subdirectories to be built)

Here is one example of how to build and link a file to the final program.

obj-y += test.o

You can create a variable in the '.config' file to control weather a set
of files will be build by defining a variable like in this example.

obj-$(MY_VAR) += test.o
