Yummy is yet another Winamp clone.
It supports Winamp plugins, services, classic skins and modern skins.
It does NOT depend on GTK+, Qt or any other toolkit.

Compiling
=========

dependencies for building:
gcc (the target MUST be 32-bit for compatibility with plugins)
g++ (for OLE)
pkg-config
make
libtool
libpng-dev, expat-dev (for modern skin engine)
libx11-dev, libxext-dev (for GNU/Linux only)

optional dependencies:
libavcodec-dev, libavformat-dev (for in_libav plugin)
libavfilter-dev (for dsp_avfilter plugin)
libao-dev (for out_ao plugin)

Create a '.config' file in the build directory. Copy a model with the same name
from the source directory for default configuration.

Hacking
=======

* cheese: compatibility layer for winamp services.
* player: GUI and main entry point.
* plugins: components to be loaded dynamically on load time.

Managing Dependencies and Portability
-------------------------------------

The build system uses autotools to detect the toolchain configurations
and dependencies. To change them, use the configure.ac file.
Try not to touch Makefile.in and Ubuild files to make it usable in other
projects.

Type the following commands to create a configure script. autotools is
necessary.

libtoolize
aclocal
autoreconf -vfi

Even though the build system does NOT use automake at all, it is necessary
to create auxiliary files that autoconf deems to be necessary. Otherwise
you will have to install them manually. Those files are: install-sh,
config.sub and config.guess. They are placed in the build-aux directory.
