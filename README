Yummy is yet another Winamp clone.
It supports Winamp plugins, services, classic skins and modern skins.
It does NOT depend on GTK+, Qt or any other toolkit.

Compiling
=========

dependencies for building:
gcc (the target MUST be 32-bit for compatibility with plugins)
g++ (for OLE)
pkg-config
make
libpng-dev (for modern skin engine)
expat-dev (for modern skin engine)

dependencies for runtime:
libpng
expat

Create a '.config' file in the build directory. Copy a model with the same name
from the source directory for default configuration.

Ubuild
======

Yummy uses its own build system called Ubuild. It was inspired by the
Kbuild system used to build the Linux kernel.

To compile one or more files, create a file called 'Makefile.ubuild'.
The language used is the same used in Makefile files. Then use the
following variables.

obj-y (specifies the source files to link in the final program)
obj-m (specifies the source files to build as separate modules)
xxx_cflags and xxx_cppflags (flags to build the xxx file)
xxx_deps (specifies additional arguments at link time such as libraries)
subdirs-y (specifies subdirectories to be built)

Here is one example of how to build and link a file to the final program.

obj-y += test.c

You can create a variable in the '.config' file to control weather a set
of files will be build by defining a variable like in this example.

obj-$(MY_VAR) += test.c
